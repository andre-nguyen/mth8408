k_r = 4;    % Order of derivative of the position
k_psi = 2;  % Order of derivative of the yaw
mu_r = 1;   % Non-dimentionalization constant for the position integral
mu_psi = 1; % Non-dimentionalization constant for the yaw integral
n = 6;      % Order of the polynomials describing the trajectory
m = 4;      % Number of waypoints

% For a quadratic optimization problem of the form
%   min c'Hc + f'c
% We know the linear term f' is nul. c is a 4nm x 1 vector containing the
% coefficients of the polynomialSo now we have to the matrix H.
