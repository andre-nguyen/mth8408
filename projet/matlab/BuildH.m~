function [ output_args ] = BuildH( n, m, mu_r, mu_psi, k_r, k_psi, t )
%BUILDH Builds the H matrix for the QP problem for the minimum snap
%trajectory generation.
% Inputs:
%   n           Order of the polynomials of a trajectory
%   m           Number of waypoints
%   mu_r        Constant making the position integrand non-dimentional
%   mu_psi      Cosntant making the yaw integrand non-dimentional
%   k_r         Order of the derivative of the position
%   k_psi       Order of the derivative of the yaw angle
%   t           Vector of the arrival times for each waypoint. Should
%               always 0 as the first element.
%
%   H           H matrix for the QP problem
