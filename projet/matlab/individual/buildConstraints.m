function [ Aeq, beq] = buildConstraints( n, r, constraints, t)
%BUILDCONSTRAINTS Builds the constraints matrix
% Inputs:
%   n           Order of the polynomials of a trajectory
%   r           Order of the derivative of the position
%   constraints r by wps+1 Matrix of constraints
%               Rows are derivatives and columns are waypoints
%               Inf denotes unfixed variable.
%   t           Time vector, always starts with 0
%
% Outputs:
%   H           H matrix for the QP problem
