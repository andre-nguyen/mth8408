function [ H ] = buildh( n, wps, mu, r, t )
%BUILDH Builds the H matrix for a single segment of the optimization
%problem
% Inputs:
%   n           Order of the polynomials of a trajectory
%   wps         Number of waypoints (not including initial conditions)
%   mu          Constant making the integrand non-dimentional
%   r           Order of the derivative of the position
%   t           Time vector, always starts with 0
%
% Outputs:
%   H           H matrix for the QP problem
